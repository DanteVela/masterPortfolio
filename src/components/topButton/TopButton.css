/* Updated CSS with Adoptive Responsive Units */
#topButton {
  visibility: hidden;
  position: fixed;

  bottom: 1.2rem; /* Kept rem unit for bottom */
  right: 1.5rem; /* Kept rem unit for right */
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 0.9375em; /* Changed from 15px to em */
  outline: none;

  border-radius: 2em; /* Changed from 2rem to em */
  font-size: 1.5rem; /* Kept rem unit for font-size */
}

/* Changes made:
1. Changed padding from 15px to 0.9375em for better scalability
2. Changed border-radius from 2rem to 2em to maintain consistency with padding
3. Kept rem units for positioning and font-size as they work well for these properties
4. Added explanatory comment at the top of the CSS block
